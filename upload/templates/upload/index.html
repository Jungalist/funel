	<div class="panel-heading"><h1>FuNeL - Functional Network Learning protocol</h1></div>
		<div class="panel-body"><p>FuNeL is a protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models. It is a general approach that uses BioHEL, a rule-based evolutionary classifier, to describe the expression samples as a set of rules and then infers interactions between genes that act together within rules to predict the samples class. FuNeL generates co-prediction networks, that capture biological knowledge complementary to that contained in popular similarity-based co-expression networks.</p>
		<h3 id="how-to">How to use Funel</h3>
		<p>The rule-based machine learning builds the model of the dataset that is later used to infer a network. It is statistically refined using permutation tests to filter out the non-significant nodes. The protocol has two optional settings: feature selection and 2nd stage of rule learning. It can be run with one of the following configurations:
		<ul>
			<li>C1 (reduced dataset + 1 machine learning phase)</li>
			<li>C2 (original dataset + 1 machine learning phase)</li>
			<li>C3 (reduced dataset + 2 machine learning phases)</li>
			<li>C4 (original dataset + 2 machine learning phases)</li>
		</ul>

		<br />Simply head over to the <a href="{% url 'upload_view' %}">upload page</a> and upload an .ARFF file with your dataset, enter your email and select your desired configuration. You will be emailed when the results are ready. The more BioHel runs and permutation tests the longer your experiment will run and the more accurate your results will be. If you are unsure about what parameters to select try setting 1, 100 permutations, 1000 runs of BioHel and 200 attributes to retain.
